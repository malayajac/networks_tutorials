I gave a tutorial at the [ICTS Summer Program on Dynamics of Complex Systems 2018](https://www.icts.res.in/program/dcs2018/" target="_blank) in June 2018. The faculty who was supposed to give the tutorial could not make it, so a couple of colleagues from my lab and I were asked to step in. My [presentation](https://github.com/malch2/networks_tutorials/blob/main/IntroToNets_networkmodels.pdf/?target="_blank") was on some of the commonly used network models. And then I gave a tutorial on how to play around with networks using Python and NetworkX using Jupyter notebooks: [notebook 0](https://github.com/malch2/networks_tutorials/blob/main/NetworkxTutorial0.ipynb/?target="_blank"), [notebook 1](https://github.com/malch2/networks_tutorials/blob/main/NetworkxTutorial1.ipynb/?target="_blank").
