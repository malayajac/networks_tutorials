# Tutorials on Network Science and NetworkX


I gave a tutorial on _An Introduction to Networks with Python_ at [PyCode 2021](https://pycode-conference.org/). The notebook for that tutorial is [here](https://github.com/malch2/networks_tutorials/blob/main/pycode2021_networks_tutorial.ipynb).

I gave a tutorial on NetworkX in August 2021 at the [Workshop on Networks and Dynamical Systems](https://web.iitm.ac.in/ccsd/workshops/complexnetworks2021.html) hosted by the Center for Complex Systems and Dynamics, IIT Madras.<br>

I gave a tutorial at the [ICTS Summer Program on Dynamics of Complex Systems 2018](https://www.icts.res.in/program/dcs2018) in June 2018. The faculty who was supposed to give the tutorial could not make it, so a couple of colleagues from my lab and I were asked to step in. My [presentation](https://github.com/malch2/networks_tutorials/blob/main/IntroToNets_networkmodels.pdf) was on some of the commonly used network models. And then I gave a tutorial on how to play around with networks using Python and NetworkX using Jupyter notebooks: [notebook 0](https://github.com/malch2/networks_tutorials/blob/main/NetworkxTutorial0.ipynb), [notebook 1](https://github.com/malch2/networks_tutorials/blob/main/NetworkxTutorial1.ipynb).
